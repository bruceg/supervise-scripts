This package is a set of scripts that may be useful for starting and
stopping programs that are managed by supervise and svscan, which are
part of the daemontools package.

daemontools was written by D. J. Bernstein <djb@pobox.com> and can be
found at http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html
I have source and binary RPMs available at
http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/daemontools/

Installing
----------

These scripts expect svscan to be started by init.  To do this, run
"make install-config".  After you have done this step, or if you are
installing from the RPM, you need to make init start svscan.  You can do
this by either rebooting, or by typing "kill -1 1" to make init re-read
its configuration file.

Upgrading
---------

supervise-scripts version 3 is functionally compatible with version 2
and up.  No changes to startup scripts should be necessary.

You will, however, need to ensure that the old svscan process is
stopped.  Doing so will also stop all running services.

Intended Usage
--------------

Create a new service directory somewhere other than /service.  Set up a
"run" script, and a "log" directory with its own "run" script if
appropriate.

Use "svc-add" to add the new service into /service for the first time.
Add the "-d" option if you don't want it to run right away (this is the
equivalent of doing "chkconfig --add" on SysVinit systems).

Use "svc-start" to start the service the first time.  If you reboot, it
will be automatically restarted without any need for intervention.

Use "svc-stop" if you need to stop the service (for maintenance).  If
you reboot after doing this, the service will not be restarted.

Use "svc-remove" before uninstalling the software.
