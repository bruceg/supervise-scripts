Changes in version 4.0

- Added svc-build, for initially creating services.

- Added svc-kill, to send named signals to services.

- Modified svc-start to ignore the stick bit on services in favor of
  just looking at the log subdirectory.  Assumes daemontools-0.76.

- Added a -k option to svc-stop to make it kill services that don't stop.

Changes in version 3.4

- svc-remove now cleans up the supervise directory from the services
  after killing supervise.

- svscan-start fixes the mode on all services with a log subdirectory
  before starting svscan, to avoid startup problems.

- Replaced the use of "let var=..." in the shell scripts with the more
  portable "var=$((...))".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 3.3
- Fixed a syntax error in svscan-add-to-inittab that affected
  (primarily) RedHat 7 systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 3.2
- Reversed the order of the arguments to svc-add, making the directory
  name mandatory instead of the link name.  If the directory name is not
  absolute, it will be prefixed with /var/service, as before.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 3.1
- Split off the functionality from "svc-start" that adds a service into
  /service into the "svc-add" script.
- Split off the functionality from "svc-stop" that removes a service
  from /service into the "svc-remove" script.
- Wrote a script to add the svscan lines to the inittab, so that they
  properly get inserted before the rc# scripts get run, as well as to
  add an entry that stops services when svscan exits.
- Made svscan-start start svscan with input and output redirected to
  /dev/console.
- Added a "-q" flag to svc-start and svc-stop that will suppress all
  non-error messages.
- Standardized all the scripts by adding the common elements to the
  configure script.
- Wrote man pages for the important scripts.

NOTE: If you are upgrading from version 3.0, please make sure you run
svscan-add-to-inittab, as install script from version 3.0 inserted the
wrong line at the wrong place in the inittab.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 3.0
- Start svscan (in /service) from init for maximum reliability.
- Populate /service with symlinks only.

Note: version 3 is backwards compatible with version 2.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 2.4
- Added configure script to handle "echo -n" vs "echo \c" differences.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 2.3
- Rewrote some non-portable shell constructs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 2.2
- Moved from the use of /var/lock/svc to having everything in
  /var/service.
- Assume that all the supervise scripts start up on boot, in the "down"
  status.
- Overhaul of svc-start and svc-stop to accomplish the above.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 2.1
- Fixed a typo in svc-start that prevented it from starting up the "log"
  service properly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 2.0
- Adapted to daemontools 0.60, with svscan started at boot, and services
  linked into /var/service
- Added a simple year-2000 compliance statement.
